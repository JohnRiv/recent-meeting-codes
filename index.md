[Recent Meeting Codes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recent-meeting-codes/jblnhjdigaepgkbclpggccmhcmnpkghf) is a browser extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

For Google Meet users with .edu accounts, this adds a list of buttons of recently used meeting codes to the Google Meet page to easily launch Google Meets with those meeting codes.
For students & teachers whose classes use Google Meet instead of Google Classroom Meet Links, this provides 1-click access to join their classes instead of having to type the same meeting code every day.
